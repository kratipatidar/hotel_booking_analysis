## Analysis of Hotel Bookings 

In this project, I employ a number of machine learning classification algorithms to classify whether a specific hotel booking would be canceled or not based on a number of features.

### Project Workflow

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to look for general trends across data and identify distributions of different variables.
2. Carry out data pre-processing and data manipulation for further processing.
3. Fit ML models to the training dataset and fine tune different training parameters.
4. Test model performance on test dataset.
5. Identify the best performing model based on performance metrics.
